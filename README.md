# Spectral mapping

Creat spectral mappings between majors satellites' at 300-2500 nm range and stored it in txt file.

RSRs folder contains the relative spectral response functions of major satellites and a python script used for read in those data is in python folder.

Ntebooks are also recommonded for reading to understand how I did it and for later debug by yourself....
